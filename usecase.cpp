/*
 * Use your BST to solve the following problem:
 * You are given a csv file in which each line represents a hex, bin pair where each bin is a 4-bit binary and each
 * hex is the corresponding 1 digit hexadecimal. Use the csv to build a BST using your BST class where each
 * node in the tree is characterized by: (1) a key of the 4-bit binary and (2) data denoting the corresponding
 * hexadecimal conversion. Your program should then accomplish the following:
 * - Ask the user for a binary value for conversion.
 * - Convert the binary value to the corresponding hexadecimal.
 * - Display the result.
 * 
 * Two examples might be as follows:
 *
 * Enter binary representation for conversion:
 * 111010100101
 * Hexadecimal representation of 111010100101 is EA5
 * Enter binary representation for conversion:
 * 110101
 * Hexadecimal representation of 110101 is 35
